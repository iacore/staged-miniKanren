abstract = "Mixed computation is processing of an incomplete information. Its product are a partially processed information and a so-called residual program destined to complete in sequel the processing of the remaining information. Many kinds of practical work with programs are nothing more but obtaining a residual program. We demonstrate, as an example, the application of mixed computation to compilation. Under computational approach mixed computation generalizes the operational semantics of a language by inclusion of steps which generate residual program instructions. Under transformational approach the residual program is obtained as a result of a series of so-called basic transformations of the program text. We argue that the transformational approach is more fundamental, for it allows to describe mixed computation in all its variety and moreover, to relate mixed computation to other kinds of program manipulation: execution, optimization, macroprocessing, synthesis. Such an integrated approach leads us to a transformational machine concept."
