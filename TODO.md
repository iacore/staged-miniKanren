- [x] Use a reify tag for quasi instead of ad-hoc knowledge for each construct.
      Then `l==` becomes `(lift (== ,(reify a) ,(reify b)))`.

- [x] Investigate how/if unstaged evalo should reenter staged code.
      Share closure representation and calling convention.

- [x] Figure out why lambdas got demoted in synthesis
      because of the shared calling convention.
      Findings: No demotion, instead `list` got promoted because its closure in `initial-env` now had the right shape.

- [ ] Make `syn-hole` robust to multiple results in the generator,
      instead of sprinkling `non-varo`s.
      Might require systematic `run*` instead of `run 1` in generator.

- [ ] Unify representation of letrec-bound procedures and lambda-bound ones.
